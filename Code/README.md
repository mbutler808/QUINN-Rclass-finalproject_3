The Code folder contains the R and .qmd files needed to build all the figures used in this project. The .qmd has been rendered to html for easy viewing.

The various `.R` scripts create the figures. 

`Analysis_code.qmd` is a Quarto file that adds commentary to this analysis. The quarto file pulls in code from the R scripts, so that only one file needs to be maintained. 

The figures outputs by the analyses are saved in Results.
