# Overview

Project 3 of R data science course. I walk through making all the figures for my thesis!

# History

 5/3/2023 first release of data and scripts
5/5/2023 final repo will all code uploaded



# Software requirements

This repo contains a data analysis project and report writing using R, Quarto, Github and a reference manager for bibtex. A plain text editor is also necessary, and wordprocessing software to open any .docx files (e.g. MS Word, MacOS Pages, or [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/)).

# Repository structure

The repository supports the notion that there should _only be one copy of code and any outputs_.
This template also uses the convention that Folder names begin with a capital letter. 

* All data goes into the `Data` folder and any subfolders.
* All code goes into the `Code` folder or subfolders.
* All results (figures, tables, computed values) go into `Results` folder or subfolders.
* All products (manuscripts, supplement, presentation slides, web apps, etc.) go into `Products` subfolders.
* See the various `README.md` files in those folders for some more information.

# Repository content

Please see the `README.md` files in each folder for more details.

* This repo begins with txt and .tre files in the `Raw_data` folder. 
* The `Analysis_code` folder contains several files that load the raw data, make figures and save the figures into Results folder 


# Getting started

The project can be reproduced by executing the code in the following order: 

1.  First run the Analysis_code.qmd or open the Analysis_code.html
2. Check the various R scripts that make all the needed figures
