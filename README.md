# Overview

A rough draft of project 3 for R Data science course

# History

2023-02-16 5/3/2023 first release of data and scripts



# Software requirements

This repo contains a data analysis project and report writing using R, Quarto, Github and a reference manager for bibtex. A plain text editor is also necessary, and wordprocessing software to open any .docx files (e.g. MS Word, MacOS Pages, or [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/)).

# Repository structure

The repository supports the notion that there should _only be one copy of code and any outputs_. Any time the intellectual content needs to be reused, it is referred to or linked from the one copy. This way we can prevent different copies of the same content from accidentally diverging, and it is easier to maintain the project. 

This template also uses the convention that Folder names begin with a capital letter. 

* All data goes into the `Data` folder and any subfolders.
* All code goes into the `Code` folder or subfolders.
* All results (figures, tables, computed values) go into `Results` folder or subfolders.
* All products (manuscripts, supplement, presentation slides, web apps, etc.) go into `Products` subfolders.
* See the various `README.md` files in those folders for some more information.

# Repository content

Please see the `README.md` files in each folder for more details.

* This repo begins with txt and .tre files in the `Raw_data` folder. 
* The `Analysis_code` folder contains several files that load the raw data, make figures and save the figures into Results folder 

Planned additions:
*Add more README files to the subfolders
*change all the embedded files to something besides pdf
*format the CSV with samples coords better
*write script to grab needed info from a few txt stats output files from phylogenetic assemblies
*find better format for reference section 

# Getting started

The project can be reproduced by executing the code in the following order: 

1.  First run the Analysis_code.qmd or open the Analysis_code.html
2. Check the various R scripts that make all the needed figures
